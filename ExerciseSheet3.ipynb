Make sure to test your codes, checking that indeed they are able to find the root of a function (to do this, you can for example pick an analytic function that allows you test the codes and for which you can compute the roots analytically).\n\n**(B)** Use your implementation of the 4 root finding methods (from part **A**) to compute the root of the function:\n\n$$f(x) = e^x - 1 - x - \\frac{x^2}{2}$$\n\nin the interval $x\\in[-1,2]$. For each method, print out the position of the root and the number of iterations needed to reach it.\n\n**(C)** Discuss your results, commenting how the methods compare to one another. Which one is the fastest/slowest? Why? What is the impact of the points you selected to start your iterations?",

The first column in the file contains the values of the velocities (in km/s), and the second column the values of the associated measurement errors (also in km/s). These data are taken from [Sollima et al. (2009)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009MNRAS.396.2183S/abstract).\n\nWe want to determine the mean velocity $\\bar{v}$ and velocity dispersion $\\sigma$ of these stars, and we do this by using a maximum likelihood estimator, following the procedure described by [Pryor and Meylan (1993)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993ASPC...50..357P/abstract).\n\nWe start by assuming that each velocity measurement $v_i$ ($i = 1,2,...,N$), with associated error $\\delta_{{\\rm v},i}$, is drawn from the normal distribution:\n\n$$ f(v_i) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi (\\sigma^2 + \\delta_{{\\rm v},i}^2)}} \\exp\\left[ - \\frac{(v_i - \\bar{v})^2}{2(\\sigma^2 + \\delta_{{\\rm v},i}^2)} \\right] $$ \n\nStandard techniques for forming the likelihood of a set of $N$ velocities and finding its maximum lead to the following two equations:\n\n$$\\sum_{i = 1}^{N}  \\frac{v_i}{(\\sigma^2 + \\delta_{{\\rm v},i}^2)} - \\bar{v} \\sum_{i = 1}^{N}  \\frac{1}{(\\sigma^2 + \\delta_{{\\rm v},i}^2)} = 0$$\n\n$$\\sum_{i = 1}^{N}  \\frac{(v_i - \\bar{v})^2}{(\\sigma^2 + \\delta_{{\\rm v},i}^2)^2} - \\sum_{i = 1}^{N}  \\frac{1}{(\\sigma^2 + \\delta_{{\\rm v},i}^2)} = 0$$\n\nThese equations must be solved numerically to obtain $\\bar{v}$ and $\\sigma$.\n\n**(A)** Discuss what type of problem this is, and list the possible ways (those we have seen in class, of course!) to solve it numerically with built-in python functions.\n\n**(B)** Solve the equations above to obtain the values of the mean velocity $\\bar{v}$ and velocity dispersion $\\sigma$. To do this, use **all** the python built-in functions we discussed in class, and compare the results you obtain. Print out the solutions you get, and verify that they are indeed solutions of the above equations.\n\n**(C)** Explore the input and output of the python built-in functions. Pay particular attention to the values you provide as initial guesses to compute the solution: which values break the algorithm? Which algorithm appears to be more stable?",
